# PowerBIemail
A power bi template file, that allows to connect to an o365 email account and uses Power BI techniques and Azure Cognitive Services to find insights that are buried in your inbox.

## Things to prepare in advance
As this PBIX reads its data from different sources, the emails from somewhere in the cloud, the stopwords from your local c drive, and mixes all this data to a fun melange, please be aware that you have to adjust security settings, meaning the privace settings of the data sources. If you are not familiar with these settings and are unsure what this means, I strongly recommend that you wait a while and start reading about the privacy settings of Power BI data sources. Be assured that I'm not reading your eamil content :-)
